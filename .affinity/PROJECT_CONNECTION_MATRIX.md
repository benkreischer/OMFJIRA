| TOKR | DARC | 10 | 13 | Low Ring (1 connection) |
| TOKR | BINT | 1 | 11 | Low Ring (1 connection) |
| TOKR | DAWA | 3 | 33 | Low Ring (1 connection) |
| TOKR | FORMS | 3 | 49 | Low Ring (1 connection) |
| TOKR | COR | 15 | 37 | Low Ring (1 connection) |
| TOKR | IMG | 2 | 337 | Medium Ring (2-3 connections) |
| TOKR | PDS | 2 | 15 | Medium Ring (2-3 connections) |
| TOKR | DBEAN | 12 | 90 | Medium Ring (2-3 connections) |
| TOKR | MOB | 21 | 42 | Medium Ring (2-3 connections) |
| TOKR | ENGOPS | 58 | 88 | High Ring (4-5 connections) |

| TOKR | COL | 9 | 36 | Hub Ring (6+ connections) |
| TOKR | LAS | 127 | 166 | Hub Ring (6+ connections) |
| TOKR | PAY | 1669 | 1835 | Hub Ring (6+ connections) |
| TOKR | QUAL | 91 | 116 | Hub Ring (6+ connections) |

## Summary Statistics (TOKR Perspective)

- **Total Projects Connected**: 18
- **Strongest Connection**: PAY (1,669 links)
- **Hub Ring Projects**: 5 (OAE, COL, LAS, PAY, QUAL)
- **High Ring Projects**: 2 (ENGOPS, CES)
- **Medium Ring Projects**: 4 (IMG, PDS, DBEAN, MOB)
- **Low Ring Projects**: 7 (SIGN, CIA, DARC, BINT, DAWA, FORMS, COR)

## Ring Classification System

- **Hub Ring (6+ connections)**: Orange nodes - Critical integration points
- **High Ring (4-5 connections)**: Blue nodes - Major connectors
- **Medium Ring (2-3 connections)**: Blue nodes - Standard integration
- **Low Ring (1 connection)**: Green/Light nodes - Minimal integration

## Key Observations

1. **PAY Dominance**: PAY has 1,669 connections to TOKR, representing 91% of PAY's total 1,835 links
2. **CES Integration**: CES has 649 connections to TOKR out of 747 total (87% of CES links)
3. **Quality Oversight**: QUAL has 91 connections to TOKR out of 116 total (79% of QUAL links)
4. **Legal/Compliance**: LAS has 127 connections to TOKR out of 166 total (77% of LAS links)
