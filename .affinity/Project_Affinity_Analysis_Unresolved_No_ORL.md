# Project Affinity Analysis - OMF Jira Project Relationships (Unresolved Issues Only, No ORL)

## Executive Summary
This analysis examines the inter-project relationships within the OMF Jira instance, focusing **only on unresolved issues** and **excluding the ORL project entirely**. The data reveals a significantly different network structure with 156 active projects, showing much lower connectivity patterns compared to the previous analysis that included resolved issues and ORL.

## Key Differences from Previous Analysis

### **Major Changes:**
1. **ORL Exclusion**: ORL was the most connected project (67 links) but is now completely excluded
2. **Lower Connectivity**: Average connections per project dropped from 15.2 to 3.1
3. **New Hub Structure**: INI (25 links) is now the most connected, vs ORL (67 links) previously
4. **Fewer Hub Projects**: No projects have 30+ connections (vs 26 previously)
5. **More Isolated Projects**: 81 projects have 0 connections (vs 0 previously)

### **Impact of Filtering:**
- **Unresolved Issues Only**: Removed all resolved issues, significantly reducing link counts
- **ORL Exclusion**: Removed the most connected project and all its relationships
- **Active Work Focus**: Analysis now reflects only current, unresolved work

## Recommendations

### **For Project Management**
1. **Focus on INI**: Prioritize communication and coordination for INI as the new central hub
2. **Identify Dependencies**: Map critical path dependencies through INI, CRSK, and CFOPS
3. **Resource Allocation**: Ensure adequate resources for high-connectivity projects (15+ links)

### **For Architecture**
1. **API Integration**: Standardize integration patterns for INI and other hub projects
2. **Data Flow**: Optimize data flow through central coordination points
3. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring for critical integration points

### **For Business Strategy**
1. **Process Optimization**: Streamline processes through central coordination hubs
2. **Risk Management**: Focus risk management efforts on CRSK and high-connectivity projects
3. **Change Management**: Implement change management processes for hub projects

### **For ORL Migration**
1. **Dependency Analysis**: Review INI's connections to understand ORL's former role
2. **Work Redistribution**: Ensure critical ORL functions are properly distributed
3. **Communication**: Update stakeholders on new project relationship patterns

## Data Quality Notes
- Total Projects Analyzed: 156 (down from 158)
- Projects with Links: 75 (down from 158)
- Projects with 0 Links: 81 (up from 0)
- Average Links per Project: 3.1 (down from 15.2)
- Most Connected Project: INI (25 links, down from ORL with 67)
- Least Connected Projects: 81 projects with 0 links

## Summary
The exclusion of ORL and filtering to unresolved issues only reveals a much more fragmented project landscape. While INI has emerged as the new central coordination point, the overall connectivity has decreased significantly. This suggests that much of the project integration was historically handled through ORL and resolved issues. The current analysis provides a clearer picture of active, unresolved work dependencies and should guide resource allocation and coordination efforts accordingly.
