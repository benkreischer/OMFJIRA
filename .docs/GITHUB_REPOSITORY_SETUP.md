# üöÄ GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Ready to Push to GitHub!

Your OMF Jira Analytics System is now ready to be pushed to GitHub. Here's how to set it up:

---

git remote -v
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.**

5. Add OMF team members by their GitHub usernames or email addresses
6. Set appropriate permissions:
   - **Read**: For team members who will use the system
   - **Write**: For team members who will contribute to development
   - **Admin**: For project managers and leads
