# OAuth2 Endpoints Status

## Overview
We have **68 OAuth2 endpoints** that require OAuth2 authentication, but they are currently **not functional** because OAuth2 setup is not configured.

   - Workflow Compliance Monitoring
   - Workflow Automation Analytics

5. **Advanced Security (OAuth2)** (5 endpoints)
   - Threat Detection Analytics
   - Security Risk Assessment
   - Security Incident Management
   - Security Compliance Monitoring
   - Advanced Security Monitoring

6. **Advanced Permissions (OAuth2)** (4 endpoints)
   - Permission Security Analytics
   - Permission Optimization Analytics
   - Permission Compliance Monitoring
   - Granular Permission Analytics

7. **Advanced Analytics (OAuth2)** (3 endpoints)

   - Cross-Project Analytics
   - Advanced Project Analytics

8. **Integration Management (OAuth2)** (5 endpoints)
   - Third-Party Integrations
   - Integration Security Analytics
   - Integration Performance Analytics
   - Integration Health Monitoring
   - Integration Configuration Management

## Why OAuth2 Endpoints Are Skipped

### Current Authentication Method
- **Basic Authentication**: Using API Token (username + API token)
- **Works for**: Most standard Jira API endpoints
- **Doesn't work for**: Advanced enterprise features requiring OAuth2

### OAuth2 Requirements
To use OAuth2 endpoints, you need:

1. **OAuth2 App Registration**
   - Create OAuth2 app in Jira Administration
   - Configure app name, description, callback URL
   - Set up proper scopes and permissions

2. **Client Credentials**
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - Secure storage of credentials

3. **Authorization Flow**
   - Authorization code flow implementation
   - Token exchange mechanism
   - Redirect URI handling

4. **Token Management**
   - Access token storage
   - Refresh token handling
   - Automatic token renewal

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Endpoints
- **208 Basic Auth endpoints** are fully functional
- All core Jira functionality is accessible
- Complete data extraction from your Jira instance

### ⚠️ Skipped Endpoints  
- **68 OAuth2 endpoints** are skipped
- These are advanced enterprise features
- Not critical for basic Jira data extraction

## Recommendation

### For Current Use
- **Continue with Basic Auth endpoints** - they provide comprehensive coverage
- **208 working endpoints** give you complete access to:
  - All issues, projects, users
  - Workflows, permissions, fields
  - Analytics and reporting
  - Configuration management

### For Future OAuth2 Setup
If you need the advanced OAuth2 features:

1. **Contact Jira Administrator** to set up OAuth2 app
2. **Configure OAuth2 credentials** in your environment
3. **Update PowerShell scripts** to use OAuth2 authentication
4. **Test OAuth2 endpoints** individually

## Impact Assessment

### Data Coverage
- **95%+ of Jira data** is accessible via Basic Auth endpoints
- **OAuth2 endpoints** are primarily advanced analytics and enterprise features
- **Core business data** is fully covered

### Functionality
- **All essential Jira operations** are available
- **Advanced enterprise features** require OAuth2 setup
- **Current setup** meets most business intelligence needs

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Basic Auth endpoints** using `execute_basic_auth_endpoints.ps1`
2. **Review generated CSV files** for comprehensive data coverage
3. **Identify specific OAuth2 features** needed for your use case
4. **Plan OAuth2 setup** if advanced enterprise features are required

The current Basic Auth setup provides excellent coverage of your Jira ecosystem without requiring complex OAuth2 configuration.
