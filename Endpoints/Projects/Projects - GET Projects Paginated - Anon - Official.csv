Phase I includes the migration of Call Recording functionality off of Avaya and on to the NICE platform. This work has 11 epics: 

* *Call Recording Core Functionality* ? reliable capture of calls, screen sessions, transfers, and escalations.
* *Metadata & Tagging* ? searchable call data, tagging, and contextual notes.
* *Quality Control & Evaluations* ? flexible evaluation forms, automated/manual call assignments, and dispute handling.
* *Process Checks & Compliance* ? system audits, dummy agent testing, and adherence verification.
* *Scorecards & Performance* ? monthly and long-term agent performance tracking.
* *Reporting & Analytics* ? configurable dashboards, scheduled reports, and real-time insights.
* *System Access & Permissions* ? role-based access controls and entitlement reviews.
* *Retention & Storage* ? secure storage, retention policies, and legal hold management.
* *SLA & Escalation* ? escalation paths, outage notifications, and continuity planning.
* *Speech Analytics* ? transcription, sentiment analysis, and PII redaction.
* *Training* ? structured onboarding and reference materials for users and admins.

This project ensures that *compliance, customer experience, and agent performance* are monitored and continuously improved through structured workflows, integrated reporting, and secure system controls.","","https://onemain.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/project/11040","Initiative; Theme; Epic; Story; Task; Sub-task; Bug; Spike; Objective; Key Result","","216","2025-10-07T16:40:51.996-0500"
