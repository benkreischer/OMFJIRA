# Trash Management Rule

## **File Deletion Behavior**
- **When user says "trash", "delete", or "remove"** → Move to `.trash/` directory
- **NEVER permanently delete files** unless explicitly requested with "permanent delete"
- **Preserve file structure** in `.trash/` when possible

## **Implementation**
- Use `Move-Item` instead of `Remove-Item`
- Create `.trash/` directory if it doesn't exist
- Maintain original filename in trash location

## **Examples**
```powershell
# ✅ DO: Move to trash
Move-Item "file.ps1" ".trash\file.ps1"

# ❌ DON'T: Permanently delete
Remove-Item "file.ps1" -Force
```

## **User Intent Recognition**
- "put in .trash" → Move to `.trash/`
- "delete this" → Move to `.trash/`
- "remove file" → Move to `.trash/`
- "trash it" → Move to `.trash/`
- "permanent delete" → Actually delete (rare case)

## **Safety Benefits**
- **Recovery possible** if file needed later
- **Audit trail** of what was removed
- **No accidental data loss**
- **Easy cleanup** of trash directory later
