# 10_Attachments.ps1 - Migrate File Attachments
# 
# PURPOSE: Downloads all file attachments from source issues and uploads them to their
# corresponding target issues, preserving file content and metadata.
#
# WHAT IT DOES:
# - Downloads all attachments from source issues
# - Uploads attachments to corresponding target issues using key mappings
# - Preserves file names, sizes, and upload timestamps
# - Handles large files and network timeouts with retry logic
# - Creates detailed migration logs and receipts
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO:
# - Does not modify attachment content or compress files
# - Does not migrate attachments for issues that failed to create
# - Does not handle attachments that exceed target environment limits
#
# NEXT STEP: Run 11_Links.ps1 to migrate issue links and relationships
