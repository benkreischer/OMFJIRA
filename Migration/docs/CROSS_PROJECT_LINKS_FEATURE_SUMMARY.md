# Cross-Project Link Documentation Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Feature Implemented

Added ability to **document skipped cross-project links** during migration so they can be **restored later** after other projects are migrated.

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

### Before:
```
Issue LAS-749 has link to CUSTIAM-834
  ↓ Migration
❌ Link to CUSTIAM-834 is lost forever
❌ No record of the link
❌ Manual research needed to find connections
```

### After:
```
Issue LAS-749 has link to CUSTIAM-834
  ↓ Migration with -DocumentSkippedLinks
✅ LAS1-4324 created
✅ Comment added documenting link to CUSTIAM-834
✅ Searchable keyword: migrationLinksSkipped
✅ Can restore link after CUSTIAM migration
```

---

## 📦 What Was Added

### 1. Enhanced Link Migration Script

**File:** `Migration/src/steps/11_Links.ps1`

**New Parameter:**
```powershell
-DocumentSkippedLinks
```

**What it does:**
- Tracks all skipped cross-project links
- Creates a formatted comment on each affected issue
- Lists all skipped links with their issue keys and relationship types
- Adds searchable keyword for easy discovery
- Provides clickable links to source issues

**Usage:**
```powershell
.\src\steps\11_Links.ps1 -DocumentSkippedLinks
```

### 2. Restoration Utility Script

**File:** `Migration/src/Utility/11_RestoreSkippedLinks.ps1` ✨ NEW

**Features:**
- Search for all issues with documented skipped links
- List issues needing restoration
- Automatically restore links when target issues exist
- Track restoration progress
- Handle partial restorations

**Commands:**
```powershell
# List all issues with skipped links
.\11_RestoreSkippedLinks.ps1 -ListOnly

# Restore specific issues
.\11_RestoreSkippedLinks.ps1 -IssueKeys "LAS1-123","LAS1-456"

# Restore all documented links
.\11_RestoreSkippedLinks.ps1 -RestoreAll
```

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation

**Files Created:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/CROSS_PROJECT_LINKS_GUIDE.md` | Complete usage guide |
| `CROSS_PROJECT_LINKS_QUICK_START.md` | Quick reference card |
| `CROSS_PROJECT_LINKS_FEATURE_SUMMARY.md` | This file |

## 🎨 Example Comment Format

When a link is skipped, this comment is added to the target issue:

```markdown
🔗 Migration Note: The following cross-project links could not be migrated:

• CUSTIAM-834 (Relates to)
• JIRA-123 (Blocks - inward)
• XRAY-456 (Is blocked by)

These links can be restored manually once the target projects are migrated.
Search for this comment to find all issues needing link restoration: migrationLinksSkipped
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Formatted in Atlassian Document Format (ADF)
- ✅ Clickable links to source issues
- ✅ Shows relationship type and direction
- ✅ Includes restoration instructions
- ✅ Searchable keyword

## 🔍 Finding Issues

### Method 1: Jira Search (JQL)
```
project = LAS1 AND comment ~ "migrationLinksSkipped"
```

### Method 2: PowerShell Utility
```powershell
.\src\Utility\11_RestoreSkippedLinks.ps1 -ListOnly
```

### Method 3: Check Migration Receipt
```powershell
$receipt = Get-Content "out\11_Links_receipt.json" | ConvertFrom-Json
$receipt.Documentation
```

Output:
```
Enabled          : True
CommentsCreated  : 45
IssuesDocumented : 45

## 📊 Migration Receipt Updates

The link migration receipt now includes a `Documentation` section:

```json
{
  "Documentation": {

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Comment Structure

- **Format**: Atlassian Document Format (ADF) JSON
- **Content**:
  - Header paragraph with emoji
  - Bullet list of skipped links
  - Each link includes: Issue key, URL, relationship type
  - Footer with instructions and search keyword

### Restoration Logic

- **Search**: Uses JQL to find documented issues
- **Parse**: Extracts issue keys from comments
- **Check**: Verifies if target issues now exist
- **Create**: Creates "Relates" links by default
- **Report**: Shows success/failure for each link

### Error Handling

- **404 errors**: Link target doesn't exist yet (normal)
- **Duplicate errors**: Link already exists (idempotent)
- **Permission errors**: Token lacks link creation rights
- **Network errors**: Uses SSL retry logic
