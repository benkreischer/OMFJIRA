# 09_RemoveComments.ps1 - Clean up migrated comments from target issues
# 
# LOCATION: Migration/src/Utility/
# PURPOSE: Removes all comments from target issues to allow re-running the comment migration
# with corrected author attribution.
#
# WHAT IT DOES:
# - Loads the key mapping to identify target issues
# - Retrieves all comments from each target issue
# - Deletes comments (optionally filtered to only delete recent ones)
# - Creates a detailed log of deleted comments
#
# WARNING: This script will permanently delete comments. Use with caution!
